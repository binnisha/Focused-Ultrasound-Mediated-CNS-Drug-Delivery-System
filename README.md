# Focused Ultrasound-Mediated CNS Drug Delivery System
## Project Context
Presentation of an Academic Research at college Project Exhibition I and II.
* Duration: August 2023 - June 2024
* Institution: VIT Bhopal University
## Study Overview
This project examined targeted ultrasound-based approaches to improve drug delivery to the CNS(Central Nervous System), with a focus on targeted brain tumor therapy and Blood-Brain-Barrier modulation.
## Research Tracks
1. Focused Ultrasound-based CNS drug delivery system
2. Focused Ultrasound and Microbubble Mediated Drug Delivery to Brain Tumor
## Roles and Responsibilities
* Reviewed the literature on CNS medication delivery and focused ultrasound technology.
* Examined current nasal medication delivery methods and their shortcomings.
* Therapeutic uses of ultrasound-microbubble interaction were examined.
* Studied the principles of the Blood-Brain-Barrier(BBB) and Blood-Brain-Tumor-Barrier(BBTB).
## Skills
